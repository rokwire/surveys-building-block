# Surveys Building Block
The Surveys Building Block manages survey data for the Rokwire platform.

## Architecture
The service is based on clear hexagonal architecture. The hexagonal architecture divides the system into several loosely-coupled components, such as the application core and different adapters. We categorize the adapters in two categories - driver and driven.

### core
This is the core component of the service. It keeps the data model and the logic of the service. It communicates with the outer world via adapters.

### driver adapters
What the service provides - user interface, rest adapter, test agent etc.

### driven adapters
What the service depends on - database, mock database, integration with other services etc.

## Documentation
The functionality provided by this application is documented in the [Wiki](https://github.com/rokwire/surveys-building-block/wiki).

The API documentation is available here: https://api-dev.rokwire.illinois.edu/surveys/doc/ui/index.html

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this project, please be sure to read the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md), [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and [Conventions](CONVENTIONS.md) before beginning.

### Secret Detection
This repository is configured with a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook that runs [Yelp's Detect Secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets). If you intend to contribute directly to this repository, you must install pre-commit on your local machine to ensure that no secrets are pushed accidentally.

```
# Install software 
$ git pull  # Pull in pre-commit configuration & baseline 
$ pip install pre-commit 
$ pre-commit install
```

If detect-secrets returns an error, ensure that the value it detected is not a secret, then run the following to update the secrets baseline file to match the current state of the codebase:

```
detect-secrets scan --baseline .secrets.baseline
```

### Environment Variables
All environment variables **MUST** be declared in the appropriate section of [app-env.json](app-env.json). Declare all secret environment variables in the `app_secret` section and all others in the `app_config` section. 

If the default value of a config is known and should be consistent across environments, provide the value directly in this file. Please note that this **DOES NOT** apply to secrets, as secret values **MUST NOT** be pushed to this repository. For other configs and all secrets, provide a hint for all required values and set all optional values to an empty string (ie. `""`).
