# <Name> Building Block
*A short description of the functionality provided by the Building Block*

## Architecture
The service is based on clear hexagonal architecture. The hexagonal architecture divides the system into several loosely-coupled components, such as the application core and different adapters. We categorize the adapters in two categories - driver and driven.

### core
This is the core component of the service. It keeps the data model and the logic of the service. It communicates with the outer world via adapters.

### driver adapters
What the service provides - user interface, rest adapter, test agent etc.

### driven adapters
What the service depends on - database, mock database, integration with other services etc.

## Documentation
The functionality provided by this application is documented in the [Wiki](https://github.com/rokwire/<name>-building-block/wiki).

The API documentation is available here: https://api.rokwire.illinois.edu/<name>/api/doc/ui/index.html
